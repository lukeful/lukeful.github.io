        My Computer Science Background
    </h1>
        <p>
            Throughout my years of high school and college, I began learning various programming languages,
            concepts, and applications, beginning with self-teaching myself Python in 9th-grade during COVID.

            FRC Robot Object Detection & Trajectory Generation
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the FRC Crescendo Season, orange, hollow discs on the ground called "notes" were used
            to score points. In order to improve intake of the robot during autonomous period (no driver/operator)
            allowed, object detection and trajectory generation were used in conjunction to correctly intake 
            game pieces. Rather than relying on computationally heavy computer vision technology, I developed 
            a light weight model  that uses HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) Color Filtering. However, the USB Camera 
            had a very limited FOV and could not see notes in close vicinity. Using a fisheye lens with 180 degrees 
            of FOV, detection of the note was converted to a field relative position using trigonometry and the robot's
            2D position.

            During the first phase of the project, I worked to improve visualization features of the SEEKR
            tool for non-linear nucleotide sequence comparison. The package includes 100+ statistical 
            distributions that can  be used for similarity comparison.
            During the second phase, I worked on incorporating embeddings from transformers/encoders 
            into hidden markov models.

        <p>
            I was the primary Python programmer who coded 14 machine learning classifiers using 18 predictors for 
            detection of atrial fibrillation (A-FIB), a heart condition that causes irregular heartbeats and affects 
            nearly 500,000 Americans.  Through ML, I achieved accuracies above 95%. There was extensive investigation into the most 
            accurate classifiers with respect to various features/estimators. The incorporation
            of a previously financial estimator, volatility, was also explored.
            <br><br>
            Later on, I developed a local web app to combine a machine learning classifier with heartrate data 
            from a smartwatch, such as an Apple Watch, to determine if there were preliminary signs of atrial 
            fibrillation for free. Currently, the local web app's backend (Python/ML processing) has not been 
            added to the model.
